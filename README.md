Filter Project is a simple and basic interactive web application that lets users browse and filter products by search keywords, categories, and price range. It demonstrates how to dynamically display and filter data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What I Did:

+ Created a product listing using a JavaScript data array.

+ Implemented search, category, and price range filters to dynamically update the displayed products.

+ Used flexbox for a responsive layout and clean design.

+ Added event listeners to handle user interactions for search input, category clicks, and price slider changes.

+ This project showcases key front-end development concepts and DOM manipulation techniques.
